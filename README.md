Inertial Sensor Gait Database 

The dataset was taken in Indonesia and Malaysia. A total of 322 under-graduate IT and Engineering students (246 males and 76 females) with ages rang-ing from 18 – 28 years participated in the database collection process. Informed consents were obtained for data collection for the ethical conduct as part of the regulation of Multimedia University. An Android application was developed to capture the data (using accelerometer and gyroscope) with 50 Hz fixed sampling rate. We also conducted an online survey to decide the sensor placement based on the participants’ top voted choices. 
Each of the participant was asked to install the application on their phones. The data collection process was carried out in a corridor inside the university building. The phones were fixed at six positions, i.e. left and right pocket, in a hand carry bag, in a backpack, and in the left and right hand (see Fig. 1). Each subject performed three different walking speeds: slow walk, normal walk and fast walk. The participants were told to walk naturally for the three walking speeds without any constraints. It took around 5-8 minutes for each subject to perform all the walks at 3 different walking speeds. In the transition to change the walking speed, they were asked to stop for 3 seconds at the turning points before walking back to the initial point.
